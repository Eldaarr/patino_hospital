This is a simple NPC that revives you if you are dead, this can be used in Roleplay servers when there are not EMS in the server or are busy. I search for something similar in the forum but i didn't find it.
I'm working in the optimization of the script (which is great) but i'm trying to reduce that CPU MSEC.
